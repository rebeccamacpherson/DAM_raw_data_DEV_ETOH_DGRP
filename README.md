# Raw Drosophila activity monitor (Trikinetics) data from six DGRP lines, assessing effects of developmental ethanol exposure corresponding to:
# Morozova T.V., Shankar, V., MacPherson, R.A., Mackay, T.F.C., Anholt, R.R.H. Modulation of the Drosophila Transciptome by Developmental Exposure to Alcohol. 2021. (in submission)
# In this manuscript, these data were analyzed using ShinyRDAM (Cichewicz, K., Hirsh, J. ShinyR-DAM: a program analyzing Drosophila activity, sleep and circadian rhythms. Commun Biol 1, 25 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-018-0031-9).
